# OpenVoxel Studio Website
A cool website yay. Check it out here: https://openvoxel.studio


## How to run?
### Run from release
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/OpenVoxelStudios/Website/releases/latest/download/openvoxel.studio.zip) and serve it with `bunx serve`, apache or what ever server you want.

### Run from code
There is some scripts in the `package.json` file that you can run. I recommend using [bun](https://bun.sh).

Don't forget to install all the dependencies with `bun i` or `npm i` (`i` stands for `install`).

### Dev run
`bunx vite` or `bunx run dev`

### Build
`bunx vite build` or `bunx run build`

### Preview Build
> (To run after the build to preview what got built)

`bunx vite preview` or `bunx run preview`


Oh also, this project uses Minecraft heads for some pages so there is a script to download them all. To run that script you can either run `bun beforeRun.ts` or run `bun i`.
