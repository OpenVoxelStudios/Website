This is a recreation of the Roblox game [Residence Massacre](https://www.roblox.com/games/14437001043/Residence-Massacre) made in 7 days.\n\nThis is best played with a group of 2-3 people.\nPlease use moody brightness, as it makes things a bit scarier.\nThis map can only be played on 1.20.2, no version before works.\n\n\n## Mechanics:\n### Cameras\n> While preparing for the night, you can find a ladder beside the generator outside. This is used to add cameras around the place to keep a watchful eye on the surroundings. This will not make you safe from the monster btw lol\n\n\n### Oxygen\n> For some reason, the ventilation in the house is poor, and hence it requires energy to keep air flowing through the house. Note that the generator doesn't have infinite fuel. You will need to go out every so often to refuel the generator to keep the air flowing.\n\n\n### Loot\n> Your house has some limited supplies that you can use to aid your survival of the night. These mainly include:\n> \n> Torch:\n> Use the torch to light up your surroundings.\n> \n> \n> Coal:\n> Coal doesn't do much by itself, but it can be used to extend the duration of the torch's light.\n> \n> \n> Stew:\n> This provides some extra energy when consumed, allowing you to sprint faster, and for a longer time.\n> \n> \n> Wrench:\n> This tool is used to fix the power in case you overload the system.\n\n\n### Lights\n> There are many lights around the house. These are used both for you to see your house during the night, and for scaring off the anomaly if it appears. Be careful about using the lights too much, as you could overload the system, forcing you to have to go outside and fix it with the wrench to prevent certain death.\n\n\n### Boards\n> Upstairs there is a pile of boards, which can be used to board up windows. This gives you extra time if the anomaly decides to pay you a visit. You cannot place boards on windows that have already been broken.\n> There also may or may not be enough boards to cover up all the windows.\n> \n> 2x2 windows cannot be boarded. The anomaly can't appear in them either. These are just used to make the house brighter during the day.\n\n\n\n### FOR THOSE USING A SERVER:\nYou will not be able to use the resource pack unless you modify the server.properties file and put a link to the resource pack.\nIf you don't feel like putting the resource pack file on something like dropbox, you can copy and paste the link below.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5jhp3rfu1jk2p9ilotd8c/ohmresourcepack.zip?rlkey=h4lre53o0xxsnn4r7bj161od2&dl=1\n\nFound a bug? Report it here:\nhttps://discord.gg/KcUX7EFAmp\n\n\n\n### __*WARNING: THIS MAP CONTAINS JUMPSCARES AND LOUD NOISES.*__",
